How to use:

1. Find the root of your Black Ops install, in steam right click the game -> manage -> browse local files
2. Copy either all the files from current steam patch or to have console and replace the files in game root
3. To be able to use the console you need to edit your player config, if you don't have a players folder in the games root launch the game at least one time, enter the main menu and close it. 
If you have a players folder go into your config.cfg file and search for "monkeytoy" you should see "seta monkeytoy "1"" set the 1 to a 0 so it looks like "seta monkeytoy "0"" and save the cfg. 
(Some people recommend you to set your config.cfg folder to Read-Only, but I've never had an issue with my config folder)

To be able to use the console hit the "`" key, it's above your tab key if on an USA keyboard, if you're using another keyboard you can rebind this key in the config.cfg.
While in mission you need to add a "/" before the command, so for example you'd write "/noclip" instead of "noclip" as the console won't read it.

Hope you enjoy!
